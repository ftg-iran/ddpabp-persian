# Dealing with Legacy Code

In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:

- Reading a Django code base
- Discovering relevant documentation
- Incremental changes versus full rewrites
- Writing tests before changing code
- Legacy database integration

It sounds exciting when you are asked to join a project. Powerful new tools and cutting-
edge technologies might await you. However, quite often, you are asked to work with an
existing, possibly ancient, code base.

To be fair, Django has not been around for that long. However, projects written for older
versions of Django are sufficiently different to cause concern. Sometimes, having the entire
source code and documentation might not be enough.

If you are asked to recreate the environment, you might need to fumble with the OS
configuration, database settings, and running services locally or on the network. There are
so many pieces to this puzzle that you might wonder how and where to start.

Understanding the Django version used in the code is a key piece of information. As
Django evolved, everything from the default project structure to the recommended best
practices have changed. Therefore, identifying which Version of Django was used is a vital
piece in understanding it.

***Change of guards***

Sitting patiently on the ridiculously short beanbags in the training room,
the SuperBook team waited for Hart. He had convened an emergency go-
live meeting. Nobody understood the emergency part since go-live was at
least three months away.

Madam O rushed in holding a large designer coffee mug in one hand and
a bunch of printouts of what looked like project timelines in the other.
Without looking up she said, "We are late, so I will get straight to the
point. In the light of last week's attacks, the board has decided to
summarily expedite the SuperBook project and has set the deadline to the
end of next month. Any questions?"

"Yeah," said Brad, "Where is Hart?" Madam O hesitated and replied,
"Well, he resigned. Being the head of IT security, he took moral
responsibility for the perimeter breach." Steve, evidently shocked, was
shaking his head. "I am sorry," she continued, "But I have been assigned to
head SuperBook and ensure that we have no roadblocks to meet the new
deadline."

There was a collective groan. Undeterred, Madam O took one of the sheets
and began, "It says here that the remote archive module is the most high-
priority item in the incomplete status. I believe Evan is working on this."

"That's correct," said Evan from the far end of the room. "Nearly there," he
smiled at others, as they shifted focus to him. Madam O peered above the
rim of her glasses and smiled almost too politely.

"Considering that we already have an extremely well-tested and working
archiver in our Sentinel code base, I would recommend that you leverage
that instead of creating another redundant system."

"But," Steve interrupted, "it is hardly redundant. We can improve over a
legacy archiver, can't we? If it isn't broken, then don't fix it", replied
Madam O tersely. He said, "He is working on it," said Brad almost
shouting, "What about all that work he has already finished?"

"Evan, how much of the work have you completed so far?" asked O,
rather impatiently. "About 12 percent," he replied looking defensive.
Everyone looked at him incredulously. "What? That was the hardest 12
percent" he added.

O continued the rest of the meeting in the same pattern. Everybody's work
was re-prioritized and shoe-horned to fit the new deadline. As she picked
up her papers, ready to leave, she paused and removed her glasses.

"I know what all of you are thinking... literally, but you need to know that
we had no choice about the deadline. All I can tell you now is that the
world is counting on you to meet that date, somehow or other." Putting
her glasses back on, she left the room.

"I am definitely going to bring my tinfoil hat," said Evan loudly to himself.

## Finding the Django Version

Ideally, every project will have a requirements.txt or setup.py file at the root
directory, and it will have the exact Version of Django used for that project. Let's look for a
line similar to this:
 
 `Django==1.5.9`

The version number is mentioned precisely (rather than Django>=1.5.9),
which is called pinning. Pinning every package is considered a good
practice since it reduces surprises and makes your build more
deterministic.

As a best practice, it is advisable to create a completely repeatable environment for a
project. This includes having a requirements file with all transitive dependencies listed,
pinning, and with --hash digests. --hash digests of the packages look like this:

`Django==1.5.9 --hash=sha256:2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5...`

Hashes protect against remote tampering and save the need to create private package index
servers containing approved packages.
Unfortunately, there are real-world code bases where the requirements.txt file was not
updated or even completely missing. In such cases, you will need to probe for various
telltale signs to find out the exact version.

## Activating the virtual environment

In most cases, a Django project will be deployed within a virtual environment. Once you
locate the virtual environment for the project, you can activate it by jumping to that
directory and running the activated script for your OS.

For Linux, the command is as follows:

```bash
$ source venv_path/bin/activate
```

Once the virtual environment is active, start a Python shell and query the Django Version,
as shown:

```bash
$ python
>>> import django
>>> print(django.get_version())
1.5.9
```

The Django Version used in this case is Version 1.5.9.
Alternatively, you can run the manage.py script in the project to get a similar output:

```bash
$ python manage.py --version
1.5.9
```

However, this option will not be available if the legacy project source snapshot was sent to
you in an undeployed form. If the virtual environment (and packages) was also included,
you can easily locate the version number (in the form of a tuple) in the `__init__.py` file of the Django directory. Consider the given example:

```bash
$ cd envs/foo_env/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django
$ cat __init__.py
VERSION = (1, 5, 9, 'final', 0)
...
```

If all these methods fail, you will need to go through the release notes of the past Django
Versions to determine the identifiable changes (for example, the `AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE`
setting was deprecated since version 1.5) and match them to your legacy code. Once you
pinpoint the correct Django Version, then you can move on to analyzing the code.

`Pipenv`, a recent but `officially recommended` Python packaging tool, aims to solve many of these problems. It combines the functionality of `pip` and `virtualenv` so that when you install a package, it updates its requirements file (called pipenv) automatically. Last but not least, it enables repeatable builds using a `Pipenv.lock` file, which is fully pinned and
includes hashes.

## Where are the files? This is not PHP

One of the most difficult ideas to get used to, especially if you are from the PHP or
ASP.NET world, is that the source files are not located in your web server's document root
directory, which is usually named `wwwroot` or `public_html`. Additionally, there is no
direct relationship between the code's directory structure and the website's URL structure.

In fact, you will find that your Django website's source code is stored in an obscure path
such as `/opt/webapps/my-django-app`. Why is this? Among many good reasons, it is
often more secure to move your confidential data outside your public web root. This way, a
web crawler will not be able to accidentally stumble into your source code directory.

As you will read in `Chapter 13`, Production-Ready, the location of the source code can be
found by examining your web server's configuration file. Here, you will find either the
`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable being set to the module's path, or it will
pass on the request to a WSGI server that will be configured to point to
your `project.wsgi` file.

## Starting with urls.py

Even if you have access to the entire source code of a Django site, figuring out how it works
across various apps can be daunting. Often, it is best to start from the root URLconf located
in the urls.py, file since it is literally a map that ties every request to the respective views.

With normal Python programs, I often start reading from the start of its executionâ€“say,
from the top-level main module or wherever the `__main__` check idiom starts. In the case
of Django applications, I usually start with urls.py since it is easier to follow the flow of
execution based on the various URL patterns a site has.

In Linux, you can use the following find command to locate the settings.py file and the
corresponding line specifying the urls.py root:

```bash
$ find . -iname settings.py -exec grep -H 'ROOT_URLCONF' {} \;
./projectname/settings.py:ROOT_URLCONF = 'projectname.urls'
$ ls projectname/urls.py
projectname/urls.py
```

## Jumping around the code

Reading code sometimes feels like browsing the web without the hyperlinks. When you
encounter a function or variable defined elsewhere, you will need to jump to the file that
contains that definition. Some IDEs can do this automatically for you as long as you tell it
which files to track as part of the project.

If you use Emacs or Vim instead, you can create a TAGS file to quickly navigate between
files. Go to the project root and run a tool called Exuberant Ctags, as follows:

```bash
find . -iname "*.py" -print | etags -
```

This creates a file called TAGS that contains the location information, where every syntactic
unit, such as classes and functions, is defined. In Emacs, you can find the definition of the
tag, where your cursor (or point as it is called in Emacs) is at using the M-. command.

While using a tag file is extremely fast for large code bases, it is quite basic and is not aware
of a virtual environment (where most definitions might be located). An excellent alternative
is to use the elpy package in Emacs. It can be configured to detect a virtual environment.
Jumping to a definition of a syntactic element is using the same M-. command. However,
the search is not restricted to the tag file, so you can even jump to a class definition within
the Django source code seamlessly. Most IDEs provide this feature under the Navigate/Go
to definition name.

## Understanding the code base

It is quite rare to find legacy code with good documentation. Even if you do, the
documentation might be out of sync with the code in subtle ways that can lead to further
issues. Often, the best guide to understanding the application's functionality is the
executable test cases and the code itself.

The official Django documentation has been organized according to versions at
https://docs.djangoproject.com. On any page, you can quickly switch to the
corresponding page in the previous versions of Django with a selector in the bottom right-
hand section of the page:

![image 01](1.png)

In the same way, documentation for any Django package hosted on readthedocs.org can
also be traced back to its previous versions.

For example, you can select the documentation of django-braces all the way back to
v1.0.0 by clicking on the selector in the bottom left-hand section of the page:

## Creating the big picture

Most people find it easier to understand an application if you show them a high-level
diagram. While this is ideally created by someone who understands the workings of the
application, there are tools that can create very helpful high-level depictions of a Django
application.

A graphical overview of all models in your apps can be generated by the graph_models
management command, which is provided by the django-command-extensions
package. As shown in the following diagram, the model classes and their relationships can
be understood at a glance:

This visualization is actually created using PyGraphviz. This can get really large for
projects of even medium complexity. Hence, it might be easier if the applications are
logically grouped and visualized separately.

## PyGraphviz installation and usage

If you find the installation of PyGraphviz challenging, then don't worry, you are not alone.
Recently, I faced numerous issues while installing on Ubuntu, ranging from Python 3
incompatibility to incomplete documentation. To save your time, I have listed the steps that
worked for me to reach a working setup:
